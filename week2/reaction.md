# Wireframing Reaction
It gives me an great insight into how to design and analysis of the UI. I learned some stuff about HTML and CSS from online resources during my first year. But I never imagined the **Wireframing** which  plays a crucial role in UX design, serving as a bridge between ideas and implementation. One key takeaway from the article is the importance of **clarifying the problem** before jumping into design. Without a clear understanding of the issue at hand, even the best design ideas may fail to meet user needs. I also took a course called Software Engineering this semster and it also highlights the importance of understanding the problem and demand correctly. Or you will make a perfect prototype for wrong problem. Another valuable insight is the emphasis on **early feedback**. Engaging stakeholders in the wireframing phase helps address technical limitations and streamline the development process. Based on the early feedback, we can adjust the goal and objective of the desgin.
Overall, this article stresses that wireframing is not just about sketching layouts but also about communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. A well-structured wireframe can save time, reduce misunderstandings, and lead to better user experiences.
